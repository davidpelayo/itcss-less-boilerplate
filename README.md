# ITCSS LESS Boilerplate

> LESS project boilerplate following the ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) methodology

## What Is It?

It's just a LESS code structure for medium-large projects.

If you're interested in finding out more about ITCSS you can [watch this talk by Harry Roberts](http://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4).

For each new project I set up I keep finding myself creating the same directory and `@import` file structure. To speed things up I've generated this repo as a quick and easy starting point.

## What It Isn't

This isn't a LESS framework. There is no actual LESS or CSS included, it's just a bare-bones directory and `@import` file structure.
