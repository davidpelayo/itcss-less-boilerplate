/*
  Settings Layer

  This layer affects the whole CSS ecosystem by setting global propertyes or variables
  transversal to the whole application. It doesn't relate to style anything. It's
  mostly like targeted for preparing settings before compiling.

  mdl-customizations.scss is not imported because it's imported on application.js
  with the sass-loader
